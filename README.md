# Dynamic Form in React JS

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens Frontend Development Challenge (Day 2). The goal is to build a dynamic form using React JS, focusing on handling user input, validation, and state management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form**: A form with multiple input fields, each with its own validation rules.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the form data and validation errors.
- **Input Validation**: Implements validation rules for each input field, providing real-time feedback to the user.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages for invalid input values.
- **Form Submission**: Handles form submission and displays a confirmation message with the submitted data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideonagyage/dynamic-form.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cd dynamic-form
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://localhost:3000.
```

## How It Works

1. Input Fields: The form includes input fields for name, email, password, and confirm password.
2. Validation: Each input field has validation rules that are checked in real-time as the user types.
3. Error Messages: If an input field is invalid, an error message is displayed below the field.
4. Form Submission: When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the form data is validated. If all fields are valid, the form is submitted and a confirmation message is displayed.

## Reflection

Building this dynamic form helped me enhance my understanding of React components, state management, event handling, and input validation. It was a great learning experience!
